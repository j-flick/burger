## Overview

Full stack web application deployed on Heroku, utilizing Node, Express, MySQL, and a custom ORM.

Users can 'Devour' a burger that is already on the menu under 'Burgers to Eat' or add their own burger for consumption.

As burgers are devoured, they are moved from 'Burgers to Eat' to 'Burgers Devoured' on the front end, and follow the same pattern on the back end database.
